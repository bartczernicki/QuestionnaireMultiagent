# QuestionnaireMultiagent

This uses Semantic Kernel and Azure OpenAI to create a multiagent system that answers questions and checks the answer.

To use this, you'll need:

.NET Core 8.0

You'll need to define the following environment variables:

AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY - a key to an Azure OpenAI deployment
AZURE_OPENAI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT - an Azure OpenAI model deployment name that is active in your resource
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT - an Azure OpenAI endpoint URL
BING_API_KEY - a key to a Bing Search v7 resource
